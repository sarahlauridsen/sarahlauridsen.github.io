        <h3>Memerories Last A Lifetime<br> - A Story About Love - </h3>
        <p class="kolonner">It is early morning when a black car slowly pulls up to the front of the church and stops. Mette is sitting with her father in the backseat waiting for him to open the door and get out. Today is her big day and in these last seconds is she hoping it is everything she’s ever dreamed of. She takes a couple deep breaths before following him out. So much preparation has lead up to this day, so she’s determined to enjoy every second of it. The first thing she notices in the corner of her eye as she steps out is a photographer shooting away. First from a little distance away and then a little closer. It makes her think of the many, many difficult decision she and Søren had to make in preparing for this day and how choosing Greg hadn’t been one of them. <br><br> Almost a whole year has passed since Søren popped the question, leaving Mette shocked and delighted. They were getting married! Which meant they had a wedding to plan and plan they did! <br><br>Like most other couples they had a budget, so they had to be smart about it. They searched far and wide for the right venue and the perfect dress and the best food. In the end they were happy with their choices, but one thing was missing: they photographer. They were both in agreement that they didn’t want the pictures of their wedding day to look staged or too perfekt. Most of all they just wanted someone to capture that beautiful moments that were bound to happen. A friend of theirs recommended they talk to Greg Mcqueen, a wedding photographer who takes documentary style wedding photos. They looked him up online an immediately fell in love with his style of photography. They decided then and there to book him for their wedding.<br><br>As Mette approached the doors with her father on her right arm Greg hurried inside. As the ceremony went along and Greg keeps snapping away at them as well as the guest, he kind of disappeared and blends into the surroundings. The hours tick by and Greg mostly stays in the background working diligently, except for the couple of times where shot some portraits of Mette and Søren. He also made sure to capture every single detail of the ceremony and reception and took loads of candid photos of the guests. Before they knew it the day had turned into night and their wedding had come to an end. In the end it had been or than they had dreamed, so the couple was happy.<br><br> Five weeks later a package arrived in the mail. They both know what it is but are excited nonetheless. They were curious to see how the photos turned out. As they flip through the pages of their wedding album it dawns on them, these are the pictures they will be taking out and showing their  kids and grandkids. Looking at the pictures they are happy they chose Greg. He managed to captured all the most significant moments like the “I do's” and the first dance. But, he also had also photographed the small things they might have forgotten other wise like the shoes she was wearing or that moment Mette’s sister had to fix her her hair because the mind had ruined it. All were memories they would cherish and share for many, many years to come.

        <h3>Q&amp;A with Greg</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Q: How would you describe your clientele? <br> A:</b> I’ve noticed that i tend to attract clients that actually don't like to be photographed. Because i think when i start talking to them they start to understand this idea, that i not gonna ask them to really stand and pose for the camera. So i realize, i’ve started to attract clients, or couples, who don’t wanna be doing that. Who actually don’t like the idea of being photographed, but still feel like the wanna have some memories and documentation of their wedding day. 
            <br><br>
            <b>Q: Then how much do you plan beforehand? <br> A: </b>Not very much - I mean if there is a special location or something that they mention… Like for example there is a couple that I’m photographing the coming season. They live in Skanderborg and he is a “skovmand”, he’s like a forest ranger, or whatever you call it. And he’s building like a little cabin in the woods for them. And they’re getting married very near by. So they’ve actually said that “some time during the reception, do you think that we could go of and just get a few shots at the cabin?” It’s not finished by any means, but they would like to kind of document that kind of document themselves there on their wedding day, their new, kind of, summer house. So if they have a specific place like that, then yeah we do plan it a little bit, but that’s about as much as we plan. We just arrive and do things that make sense for them.
            <br><br>
            <b>Q: How long in advance do people start contacting you? <br>A: </b>It ranges, sometimes it’s a year in advance. I have one wedding I’m shooting  in August and they contacted me before last August. So, it was over a year. And then bookings start taking up through September, November, December -- it kind of starts and and then for some reason in January I think a lot of couples suddenly realize “oh my goodness it’s the New Year and we got the wedding in summer. We better figure something out. So, I’d say probably half of the bookings I have for this year all arrived in January. So, it ranges.
